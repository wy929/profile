[The Day After Tomorrow: Real-time Storm Forecasting](https://github.com/acse-wy1223/ACSE/tree/main/acds-the-day-after-tomorrow)
- The project aims to improve emergency response protocols for hurricanes by forecasting the evolution of tropical cyclones in real-time using ML/DL techniques. Participants are tasked with designing and implementing ML/DL models to predict future satellite images and wind speeds based on provided data from 30 historical storms. The final solution has two models built with **PyTorch**: 1. Image Generation Model (**Encoder+ConvLSTM+Decoder**): generate future image predictions based on these existing images. 2. Prediction Model (**Refined CNN-LSTM**): predict wind speed based on the provided time series data.
- Achieve the **best** score in final prediction.

- The project aims to improve emergency response protocols for hurricanes by forecasting the evolution of tropical cyclones in real-time using ML/DL techniques. Participants are tasked with designing and implementing ML/DL models to predict future satellite images and wind speeds based on provided data from 30 historical storms. The final solution has two models built with **PyTorch**: 1. Image Generation Model (**Encoder+ConvLSTM+Decoder**): generate future image predictions based on these existing images. 2. Prediction Model (**Refined CNN-LSTM**): predict wind speed based on the provided time series data.
- Achieve the **best** score in final prediction.

- Modelling the dynamics of airbursts of meteorites is a huge computational challenge. In this project we explored the effects and hazards caused by small asteroids as they enter the Earth's atmosphere. Our team has developed an optimisation method for finding the asteroid radius and strength that gives the precise fit to an observed energy deposition curve for the Chelyabinsk meteor; developed a airburst solver capable of predicting the energy and location of explosions; developed an airburst damage mapper to plot damage zone and determine high-risk postcodes with user-friendly interface.
- Achieve the **best** performance in solver execution efficiency.
